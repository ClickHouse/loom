# Changelog

All notable changes to Loom (the server, its web app and its coding-agent plugins). The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). The SDKs keep their own changelogs in
[sdk/python](./sdk/python/CHANGELOG.md) and [sdk/typescript](./sdk/typescript/CHANGELOG.md).
A release tag `vX.Y.Z` ships only when the top entry reads `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The blue/green colours (`dev/docker-compose.colour.yml`) run the bubblewrap
  repository-job sandbox, so `/v1/health` no longer reports `repo_jobs_unsandboxed` there.
  They use narrow profiles instead of `unconfined`: `dev/seccomp/loom-repo-sandbox.json`
  (Docker's default plus one rule allowing `clone`, `unshare`, `mount`, `umount2` and
  `pivot_root` to every process; the default allows the first four only with
  `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, and `pivot_root` never), the AppArmor profile `deploy/apparmor/loom-repo-sandbox` (`docker-default` for every
  process, and a child profile adding `userns, mount, pivot_root` for whatever execs
  `bwrap` and what it runs) and `systempaths=unconfined`, plus `pids_limit: 8192` per
  container as a backstop. Load the AppArmor profile on the host before the next
  redeploy; `redeploy.sh` (through `dev/apparmor_check.sh`) stops when it is missing or
  the host has no AppArmor, and removes the new colour instead of swapping to it when the
  sandbox probe fails in either of its containers.
  The other Compose stacks are unchanged. See "Repository-job sandbox" in
  docs/operations/code-index-operations.md.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `rerank` (`memory.search`, `memory.search_trace`, `code.search`, `code.ask`)
  and a namespace's `rerank_endpoint` take a name, not a URL: `none`, `builtin:openai[:model]`,
  `builtin:cohere[:model]`, or an endpoint the operator names in `LOOM_RERANK_ENDPOINTS_JSON`.
  A URL or an unknown name is a 422. A namespace that still stores a URL is no longer reranked.

### Fixed

- `LOOM_CODE_SANDBOX_MAX_PIDS` bounds each repository job: it is set inside the job's
  user namespace, so on Linux 5.14 and later it no longer counts every task of the
  server's uid on the host.
- Where an AppArmor profile refuses the sysctl write of bwrap's `--disable-userns`, the
  sandbox probe retries without the flag instead of reporting the sandbox unavailable;
  Loom's seccomp filter still refuses jobs new user namespaces.
