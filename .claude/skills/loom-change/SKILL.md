# Making a Loom change

Find the row for the change, read its guide before the first edit, and finish its "also" column in the same pull request. The rules under `.claude/rules/` add the area-specific traps.

| Change | Guide | Also in the same PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wire op (new, renamed, removed field) | [adding-an-operation](../../../docs/development/adding-an-operation.md) | `python -m scripts.codegen.sdk_py_gen`, `.sdk_py_client_gen`, `.sdk_ts_gen`, `.docs_reference`, `.op_reach_census`; unit test + integration test for a read or write path; MCP listing budget if it is listed by default; its dashboard control, or a `NOT_IN_DASHBOARD` reason in `server/operations/dashboard.py` |
| Table or column | [adding-a-table](../../../docs/development/adding-a-table.md) | migration + `make schema-dump`; RMT row builders; `loom.memory_versions` + its view for a `loom.memory` column; erasure step + census row, or a `NO_MEMORY_CONTENT` / `STEP_ONLY_TABLES` entry with its reason |
| Migration | [migrations](../../../docs/development/migrations.md) | next free number on current `origin/main`; additive only; `make schema-dump` on a private ClickHouse (with none at hand, leave `schemas/schema.sql` unchanged and report the dump as pending; never hand-edit it); written values N-1 tolerates ([rolling upgrades](../../../docs/architecture/rolling-upgrades.md)), `make test-mixed-version` |
| Setting | [extending-loom](../../../docs/development/extending-loom.md#add-a-setting) | field in its area's section of `server/settings/catalog.py` (models in `Models`) with a comment on what it controls and its values; `python -m scripts.codegen.settings_reference`, `.settings_schema` and `.settings_example`; read as `settings.<field>`; a rename or removal follows the [settings rule](../../rules/settings.md) |
| Retire a flag | — | delete the setting, its branch and any request field carrying it; the PR body's changelog entry names it |
| Worker | [adding-a-worker](../../../docs/development/adding-a-worker.md) | registry row; `LOOM_UPDATE_WORKER_SNAPSHOT=1` for an intended snapshot change |
| Provider | [extending-loom](../../../docs/development/extending-loom.md#add-a-provider) | `make bench-quick` evidence before changing a default (ask first — see `loom-bench`) |
| Code-index language | [adding-language-support](../../../docs/development/adding-language-support.md) | stay outside the extractor stamp; backfill plan in the PR |
| CLI command or flag | [code-generation](../../../docs/development/code-generation.md) | `LOOM_UPDATE_CLI_SNAPSHOT=1` snapshot; `python -m scripts.codegen.docs_reference`; a command the chart's hook Jobs run (`deploy/helm/loom/templates/hooks.yaml`) changes there too |
| Plugin file (hook, `lib/`, `bin/`, skill, `assets/`, `.mcp.json`, Codex `plugin-defaults.json`, a manifest's listing fields) | [integrations](../../../integrations/claude-code-plugin/README.md) | hook scripts, `lib/`, `bin/`, skills and `assets/`: edit `integrations/claude-code-plugin/`, then `python -m scripts.codegen.agent_plugin_sync`; a manifest, `hooks.json`, `.mcp.json` or `plugin-defaults.json`: edit each plugin's own copy (`plugins` rule); for a behaviour change, bump both plugin manifests to a version no other open PR uses |
| Dashboard | [dashboard-design](../../../docs/development/dashboard-design.md), [local-development](../../../docs/development/local-development.md#the-dashboard) | `npm --prefix frontend run test`, `npm --prefix frontend run build`, bundle budget, `make lint` (Biome's accessibility rules) |
| Helm chart | [kubernetes](../../../docs/operations/kubernetes.md) | `helm lint --strict` and `kubeconform` on both overlays; a renamed setting as in the Setting row |
| Docs | [documentation-style](../../../docs/development/documentation-style.md) | regenerate generated pages; never hand-edit them |

## Before the first edit

- A new table, op group, auth-model change, external dependency or identity-tuple change is a material change: the PR body carries the design (what, why, the alternatives and their cost, the migration story), and the matching `docs/architecture/` page describes the system as it now is ([material changes](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#material-changes)).
- Read the rule for each area the change touches (`AGENTS.md`, "Rules by area"), and search for the helper you are about to write.
- Moving a module: shipped files resolve through `server.core.paths`, never `Path(__file__).parents[N]`.

Then run `loom-pre-push`.
